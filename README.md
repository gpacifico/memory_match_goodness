# Steven Matchiverse

<em>Steven Universe</em> themed card matching concentration game. Includes a randomizer that changes the positions of 
the cards after each game to increase difficulty and a prize for successful completion of the game. Also includes a stats
column that shows how many games you have played, how many attempts it took you to win each game, and your accuracy.
There is a reset button too so you can easily start a new game. No more than two cards can be revealed at a time, so you need to
concentrate to win!
